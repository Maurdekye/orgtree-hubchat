Hubchat 1.0.4: on Samsung phones, Hubchat now explains how to hide only its background connection notification, so message notifications can stay on.

## Downloads

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `Hubchat_1.0.4_x64-setup.exe` | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit. The installer isn't code-signed, so if SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", choose **More info › Run anyway**. Hubchat 0.1.1 and later offer this update themselves. |
| `Hubchat_1.0.4_arm64.apk` | Android 7.0 or later on 64-bit ARM, which covers most phones. Allow your browser or file manager to install apps when Android asks. Hubchat 0.1.3 and later offer this update themselves. **Coming from 0.1.2 or earlier, install this one by hand.** |
| `Hubchat-android.apk` | The same Android app under a name that stays the same in every release, so a link to the latest one always works. |
| `Hubchat_1.0.4_universal.dmg` | **Prototype** for macOS, Apple Silicon and Intel. Not yet tried on a real Mac. See [First run on macOS and Linux](#first-run-on-macos-and-linux). |

## What's new

- **Hide only the connection notification on a Samsung phone (Android).** While **Stay connected** is on, Android requires Hubchat to show a quiet notification (**Hubchat is connected**). A Samsung phone first shows one switch for all of Hubchat's notifications, so turning that one off silenced new messages too. On a Samsung, **Settings › Notifications** now shows how to turn off just the connection notification:
  1. In your phone's **Settings › Notifications › Advanced settings**, turn on **Manage notification categories for each app**.
  2. In Hubchat's notification settings, turn off **Background connection** and keep **Messages** on.

  The **Open notification settings** button goes straight to Hubchat's notification settings. You can also long-press the Hubchat notification and tap the gear.

## First run on macOS and Linux

- **macOS:** the app isn't signed by Apple or notarized (that needs a paid Apple developer account), so macOS blocks the first open.
  - On macOS 15 or later, try to open Hubchat once. Then go to **System Settings › Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
  - On macOS 14 or earlier, right-click the app and choose **Open**.
  - Or, in Terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Hubchat.app`
  - After an update, macOS may ask once more whether Hubchat may use its Keychain entry. Choose **Always Allow**.
- **Linux:**
  - **AppImage:** run `chmod +x Hubchat_1.0.4_amd64.AppImage`, then start it. It needs FUSE 2: `sudo apt install libfuse2` on Ubuntu 22.04, or `libfuse2t64` on 24.04 and later. It updates itself.
  - **.deb:** `sudo apt install ./Hubchat_1.0.4_amd64.deb`. Updates ask for your password, because they reinstall the package.
  - Hubchat keeps your identity key in the desktop keyring (GNOME Keyring or KWallet). Without a keyring, creating an identity shows an error instead of keeping the key only in memory.
